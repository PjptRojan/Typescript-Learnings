// ts compiler takes input typescript and outputs javascript. But javascript has multiple versions of it depending on runtime.
// so if you want a js version that is sure to run on everywhere (node and all browsers), then we should use ES5 on the target property.
// but if you want to target specific node runtime that contains alot of modern features of js then we can use modern versions of js.

{
    "compilerOptions" : {
        "target": "ESNext"
    }
}

// how does the config file works: tsc (running only tsc command will look for a default config file)
