// type assertions: it is a language mechanism that allows us to directly assign type to a given variable. we should use it when we have more \
//information about the variable than the compiler does.
const input = document.getElementById("input-field"); // one way to do type assertion
const inputOne = document.getElementById('input-one'); // alternative way to do type assertion (also called casting before). 
// limits of type assertion mechanism: it allows to define more specific type than the starting type.
